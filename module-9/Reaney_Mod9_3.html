    <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

    <p class="intro">Welcome to my webpage. My name is Christopher Reaney. I live in Audubon,
        PA and I have lived in the vicinity for about 15 years. I am currently employed
        as a Senior Programmer, and <span id="hidden-words-1">________</span> this role for about 2 years. Before
        that I worked as a level 2 IT service desk employee.
    </p>
    <p>My family moved to this area after the stock market crashed in 2008. 
        <span class="sentence">We have lived here happily ever since.</span> I have two brothers that live about
        an hour away from me. My mom and grandmom currently live in North Carolina.
    </p>
    <p>I have worked with <span id="hidden-words-2">________</span> about six years old. I first started
        learning with Python by making very crude text-based games. I have since learned
        several other languages including but not limited to: Java, Groovy, Powershell, C, 
        and SQL. 
    </p>
    <p>I also like to <span id="hidden-words-3">________</span> trucks. I am generally interested in just about
        anything that I can do by getting my hands involved. I like to tinker and fix
        broken things so that they work again. Years ago I used to work as an EMT and 
        the concept of <span id="hidden-words-4">________</span>true there as well, only the things were 
        people.
